It is no secret that mainstream Data Center applications are migrating to cloud. Similarly in the
Security and Wireless Communications industry, this trend is emerging as well. Security
applications such as Firewall, DDoS prevention, WAF, etc., have a natural affinity since the
business logic has already moved in this direction and requires protection and portability. Over
the last two decades, all major security and networking appliances become virtualized on-premise
and in the public cloud, untethered and agnostic from hardware they run on. Also, as telecom and
enterprise customers adopted the hybrid cloud strategy, the need for platform portability gained
more momentum as customers may have a different cloud platform on-premise and in the public cloud
while using the same networking functions.

Intel and Highway9 Networks collaborated on a [white paper](/assets/papers/CNDP_5G_Mobility_Edge.pdf)
detailing the Highway9 Networks Virtual Mobility Cloud which allows cloud consumption of 5G
services for enterprise.
